    ## Postdoctoral Researcher, Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work (FIFSW), University of Toronto (UofT)

    I’m James Stannah. I'm a <u>social epidemiologist and global health researcher</u> with a focus on HIV and other sexually transmitted and bloodborne infection (STBBI) prevention, and sexual health and wellbeing among marginalised populations, in particular LGBTQIA+ people and women and girls. My research explores how social and structural factors, like stigma, discrimination, interpersonal violence, and legal barriers, affect health and wellbeing outcomes and access to care across diverse settings in the Global North and South. Recently, through joining the [SSHINE Lab](https://sshinelab.com/) at UofT led by Dr. Carmen Logie, I have begun looking at the impacts of climate change and extreme weather on resource insecurity and sexual and reproductive health outcomes.
